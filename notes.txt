Redux solves the problem of having to pass informataion across components by writing props in each component

Redux creates a store for the information to live in
 - dispatch an action to access the necessary information
 - Create one store for each application for ease

A reducer is a function that runs whenever it is dispatched

The provider wraps the entire application and allows for the app to communicate to the redux store

CombineReducers takes all reducers and mashes them into one, which will then go into the store

If we are getting information from the redux store we must mapReduxStateToProps
